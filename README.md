Alt Text for Images
Descriptive Alt Text: All images on the website, including those used in project cards and category sections, have appropriate alternative (alt) text. This text provides a description of the image for users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

Keyboard Navigation Support
Keyboard Accessibility: The website is designed to be fully navigable via keyboard. Users can use the Tab key to move through interactive elements such as links, buttons, and form fields, and the Enter key to activate them.

Focus Indicators: Visual indicators (such as outline borders) are provided when a user focuses on a clickable element, ensuring that keyboard users can easily identify where they are on the page.

Accessible Forms: All forms, including the login, registration, and project submission forms, have proper labeling and are navigable using the keyboard, ensuring that users with mobility impairments can interact with them easily.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Backend  

### **Data Structure & Relationships**  
Database Design for The Crochet Nook
When designing an efficient and user-friendly database for The Crochet Nook, we followed a structured approach consisting of the following phases:

Requirements Analysis - Identifying the purpose of the database

Organizing Data into Tables - Determining the database structure

Normalizing to Standardize the Tables

Source: Lucidchart Database Diagram / Database Design

1. Requirements Analysis - Identifying the Purpose of the Database
The first phase of the database design process involved clearly understanding the purpose of the database for The Crochet Nook. The primary objective was to create a platform where users can share crochet projects, interact with other users through comments and likes, and explore crochet projects categorized by type and difficulty.

To complete this phase, we gathered insights from potential users to determine the types of information they expect to interact with when visiting a crochet project platform. Through user interviews and research into similar crochet-sharing platforms, we identified key features needed for the website, such as:

Project Details: Each crochet project should have detailed information like project title, description, images, and category.

User Interactions: Users must be able to like and comment on projects.

Categorization: Projects should be organized into categories like blankets, scarves, hats, and more, to make browsing easier.

User Authentication: Since only registered users can like, comment, and upload projects, user authentication was a priority feature.

2. Organizing Data into Tables - Determining the Database Structure
The second phase involved organizing the collected requirements into a structured format that could be translated into database tables. This process included determining the necessary tables, their fields, and how they relate to each other.

In this phase, we identified the following real-world entities that would be represented in the database:

Users: Store user details and authentication information.

Crochet Projects: Include project details like title, description, images, and category.

Categories: Organize crochet projects into predefined types like blankets, scarves, etc.

Comments: Allow users to comment on crochet projects.

Likes: Enable users to like crochet projects.

Each of these entities was translated into its own table:

User Table: Contains fields for user details such as username, email, and password.

Crochet Project Table: Contains project details, category, user (creator), and image fields.

Category Table: Contains the name and description of each category.

Comment Table: Links to both a user and a crochet project and stores comment content.

Like Table: Links to both a user and a crochet project and stores information about user likes.

We also mapped the relationships between these tables. This step is critical for understanding how the data interacts:

One-to-Many Relationships:

A User can create many Crochet Projects.

A Category can have many Crochet Projects.

Many-to-Many Relationships:

A User can like many Crochet Projects, and a Crochet Project can be liked by many Users. This was resolved by creating a Like table to handle the many-to-many relationship.

After analyzing the relationships and cardinalities, we refined the structure and ensured that the data was efficiently divided into the correct tables.

3. Normalizing to Standardize the Tables
Normalization is crucial for maintaining database integrity and reducing redundancy. The Crochet Nook‚Äôs database was designed to ensure that each piece of data was stored only once and that there were no unnecessary duplicates across tables.

Normalization was done using the following guidelines:

First Normal Form (1NF): Ensured that all fields in the database contained atomic values, meaning each field in a table holds only one value.

Second Normal Form (2NF): Eliminated partial dependencies by ensuring that non-key attributes were fully dependent on the primary key.

Third Normal Form (3NF): Removed transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes were directly dependent on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes.

For example, the Project Table will not have duplicate data for categories. Instead, categories are stored separately in a Category Table, which links back to the project via a foreign key. This helps avoid repeating category data in each crochet project entry.

Additionally, each User is linked by a foreign key to their Crochet Projects, Comments, and Likes, ensuring that user-related data is normalized and not duplicated across multiple tables.

Authentication Process: The process for users includes account creation, signing in, and session management. Django's AuthenticationForm and LoginView are used to handle these operations.

Password Handling: User passwords are securely stored by Django using hashing algorithms, ensuring that no plain-text passwords are saved in the database.

User Registration
Account Creation: Users can create an account by providing necessary details like username, email, and password.

Account Verification: Users may be required to verify their email address via an activation link sent to their inbox, ensuring their email is valid.

Authorization and Permissions
Role-Based Access: The system distinguishes between different types of users such as regular users and admins. Each user role is assigned different permissions.

Permission Management: Permissions control what users are allowed to do. For example, regular users can view projects but only registered users can add their own crochet projects.

Session Management
Session Security: Sessions are handled securely by Django, using cookies that store session data for the user. Secure cookies are used to prevent unauthorized access.

Session Expiry: Sessions may expire after a certain period of inactivity or after a specified amount of time to enhance security.

Data Security
Encryption: Sensitive data, including passwords, are encrypted and stored securely. Django uses the PBKDF2 algorithm for password hashing.

HTTPS: The application uses HTTPS to ensure all data transmitted between the user and the server is secure.

Two-Factor Authentication: If two-factor authentication is implemented in the future, users will be able to enable it to further secure their accounts.

Input Validation and Security
Form Validation: User input is validated to ensure that email formats are correct, passwords meet strength requirements, and to prevent malicious inputs.

Security Best Practices: Django‚Äôs built-in protections such as protection against cross-site request forgery and clickjacking ensure that the app remains secure. User inputs are sanitized to prevent malicious code execution.

Account Recovery
Password Reset: Users can reset their passwords through an email verification link. A secure token is generated to allow users to change their password.

Account Deletion: Users may have the option to delete their accounts, ensuring that all associated data is safely removed from the system.

Logging and Monitoring
User Activity Logging: User activities such as logging in, adding projects, or making comments may be logged for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Error Monitoring: Errors related to user security or authentication are logged to help identify and address issues quickly.
