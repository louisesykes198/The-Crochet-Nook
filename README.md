## 🎨 Design & Branding  

### **Logo**

The logo features the text "The Crochet Nook" written in a stylish, handwritten script font that gives off a cozy and personal feel. The text is in black against a light blue background, enhancing readability while maintaining a soft, welcoming aesthetic. The playful and artistic style of the font conveys a sense of creativity, fitting well with the handmade, crafty vibe typically associated with crochet.

### **Colour Scheme**  

The Crochet Nook features a soft and inviting color palette that reflects the cozy, handcrafted essence of crochet. The site’s background uses a calming pastel blue (#C3E4F8), creating a gentle and welcoming atmosphere.

Content is organized using clean white cards (#FFFFFF) for clarity and contrast. Project cards are enhanced with a delicate pale pink dotted border (#FCDDE8), adding a subtle touch of charm and warmth that complements the overall pastel theme.

Each project card includes three pastel-colored buttons designed for clarity and accessibility:

- View Project: A light blue button that invites users to explore more.

- Edit: A soft yellow button that adds a cheerful, approachable tone for updates.

- Delete: A gentle pink button that maintains visual harmony while signaling caution.

This carefully curated palette ensures a cohesive, soothing, and user-friendly experience, aligning perfectly with the comforting and creative spirit of the crochet community.

### **Typography** 

The Crochet Nook uses a combination of two fonts — Rock Salt and Quicksand — to reflect both personality and readability throughout the site.

Rock Salt:
This playful, hand-drawn font brings a handcrafted, whimsical vibe to the site. Inspired by real handwriting with a slightly rough texture, it's perfect for headings or branding elements that need a personal, artsy touch, fitting the handmade spirit of crochet.

Quicksand:
A clean, rounded sans-serif font that’s modern, friendly, and easy to read. Quicksand is used for body text and content areas, providing excellent readability while maintaining a soft and approachable look that complements the cozy aesthetic of the platform.
